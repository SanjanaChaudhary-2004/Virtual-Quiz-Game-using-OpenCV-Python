# Virtual-Quiz-Game-using-OpenCV-Python
This project is a gesture-controlled quiz game that uses OpenCV and Hand Tracking to allow users to answer multiple-choice questions without a keyboard or mouse. The webcam captures real-time video, detects hand movements, and lets users select answers using finger gestures. Questions are loaded from a CSV file, making the quiz easily customizable.
